When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when working on a project in a team that has many contributors.This would make it easy to collaborate on the
project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Having git handle pull and push automatically may lead to additions that are not yet complete.Choosing manually when to do so
allows me to control the changes and therefore makes them more logical as I do the pull/push
