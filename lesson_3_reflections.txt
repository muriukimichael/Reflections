When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when working on a project in a team that has many contributors.This would make it easy to collaborate on the
project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Having git handle pull and push automatically may lead to additions that are not yet complete.Choosing manually when to do so
allows me to control the changes and therefore makes them more logical as I do the pull/push

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks-these are clones that only exist on github
clones-these are local copies of a github repository
branches-these are alternate paths in the commit workflow in github from the master

usage
forks-when making changes to code that's not mine
clone-when working on code from a github repository locally
branches-when testing an experimental feature as i write code

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-its makes it possible to know when the commits have progressed even without internet connection.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
sending the whole code mannually using mail or using dropbox to share the code files
Github makes it very easy to track the changes and collaborate effectively
Sending the files individually is a lot harder and cumbersome especially as the size grows


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
when testung a new experimental feature that could damage the master.The benefit is that having a different brtanch to test the 
feature protects the main code files from breaking as the new feature is active.
