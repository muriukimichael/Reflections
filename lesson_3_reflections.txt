When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when working on a project in a team that has many contributors.This would make it easy to collaborate on the
project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Having git handle pull and push automatically may lead to additions that are not yet complete.Choosing manually when to do so
allows me to control the changes and therefore makes them more logical as I do the pull/push

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks-these are clones that only exist on github
clones-these are local copies of a github repository
branches-these are alternate paths in the commit workflow in github from the master

usage
forks-when making changes to code that's not mine
clone-when working on code from a github repository locally
branches-when testing an experimental feature as i write code
